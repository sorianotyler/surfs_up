# waves_and_ice_cream_anlaysis

## Overview of Project
 The objective of this project is to perform a statistical analysis on the weather in Hawaii in June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. 
### Purpose
    The purpose of this challenge was to use sqlalchemy to quickly gather information and analyze it without creating an entire SQL database. 

 
## Results 
Three Key Differences between June and Decemeber:
- The min temperature in December is 8 degrees colder than it is in June (56 and 64 respectively)
-  The Max Temperature in December is 2 degrees colder than it is in June (83 and 85 respectively)
- The mean Temperature in December is 3 degrees colder than it is in June (71 and 74 respectively)

## Summary 
- From the results, you can infer that the weather is pretty consistent year round. The average temperatue for each month has a 3 degree difference with the low temperature only being a 8 degree temperature. I would query to see the precipitation of each month. If it is raining in Decmeber consistently the ice cream business might not be sustainable that month. I would also query to see the statistics of each station. With this I can get the general location in which a ice cream shop will be sustainable year round.
